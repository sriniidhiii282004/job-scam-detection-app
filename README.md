    node app.js

### Prediction model:

Go to prediction-model folder, open the terminal and run following command

    python -m venv venv

    source venv/bin/activate

Above command sets up your python environment and activate it


Following procedure is done for nlk library, which we use in our project. It gives error in running like certificate issues.
    For mac users- 
        * Go to Application folder
        * Find Python 3.x folder
        * Double click on - Install Certificates.command or on Install Certificates.tool
        * After it gets finished run your train model script

            python train_model.py

After that run this command to start the prediction model

    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

Now both the projects started now you can explore the app
